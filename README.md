Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
I am a Computational Physicist with a deep interest in statistical modelling, data science, and computational methods for complex systems.

## About Me

- **Background:** PhD in Applied and Theoretical Mechanics, from Sapienza Università di Roma  
- **Research Interests:**  
  - Statistical modelling  
  - Data science & machine learning
  - Large Language Models 
  - Molecular dynamics simulations  
  - Complex materials
- **Current Focus:** Developing tools and models to analyze, simulate, and understand the intrinsic properties of advanced materials.

## Featured Projects

### 🧬 GrafTo: Polymer-Grafted Surfaces Builder
Libraries for building and analyzing coarse-grained molecular dynamics structures of polymer-grafted surfaces. These tools help researchers efficiently set up, visualize, and interpret simulation data for polymers at interfaces.

### 🤖 PyISV: Autoencoder to find Intrinsic State Variables (ISVs)
A neural network autoencoder designed to identify suitable intrinsic state variables for complex materials, such as metallic nanoclusters. This work aims to bridge the gap between data-driven insights and physical understanding in material science.

### ⚽ World Cup Monte Carlo Simulation
A fun project that applies Monte Carlo methods to simulate outcomes of the most recent World Cup, demonstrating the power of probabilistic modelling in real-world scenarios.

### 🎬 Movie Recommender App (LLM + RAG)
A web-based application that leverages Large Language Models and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide personalized movie recommendations. This project combines modern AI with an interactive user interface for an engaging experience.
